	    <li><h4 style="color:blue;">This is a heading</h4>
	    <p>The HTML contains style information for a document, or part of a document. By default, the style instructions written inside that element are expected to be CSS.</p>

	    <p>The HTML <small> element makes the text font size one size smaller (for example, from large to medium, or from small to x-small) down to the browser's minimum font size.

	    <li><h2>HTML <mark>Marked</mark> Formatting</h2></li>
	    <p>The HTML element represents highlighted text, i.e., a run of text marked for reference purpose, due to its relevance in a particular context. For example it can be used in a page showing search results to highlight every instance of the searched-for word.</p>

	    <li>This is <sub>subscripted</sub> text.</li>
	    <p>The HTML <sub> element defines a span of text that should be displayed, for typographic reasons, lower, and often smaller, than the main span of text.</p>

	    <p>The HTML element indicates that the enclosed text is a short inline quotation. This element is intended for short quotations that don't require paragraph breaks; for long quotations use the element.</p>

	    <li>The <abbr title="World Health Organization">WHO</abbr> was founded in 1948.</li>
	    <p>The HTML <abbr>element represents an abbreviation and optionally provides a full description for it. If present, the title attribute must contain this full description and nothing else.</p>
